Slideshow now renders this new slide as the final slide and passes existing SFX settings into it. Some requirements cannot be fully verified due to truncation and missing evidence of bundled 3D model assets.",

      "reason": "The mapping references model paths under /assets/models/*.glb, but the diff summary does not show any added/modified static 3D model files under the frontend assets directory, so bundling/offline availability is not evidenced.",
