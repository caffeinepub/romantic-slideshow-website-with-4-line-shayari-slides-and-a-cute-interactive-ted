  "summary": "Diff adds a new EndingGameSlide component and updates Slideshow to render it as the final slide instead of the teddy mini-game. The new game appears to support mouse and touch interactions, includes English instructions, visual feedback (hearts/sparkles), progression toward a goal, and a completion/reset flow. There are also unrelated/extra edits (e.g., TeddyGameSlide and global CSS/theme updates).",

    {
      "description": "Modified TeddyGameSlide even though the BuildRequest only required replacing it on the final slide (not changing its implementation).",
      "reason": "BuildRequest focuses on replacing the final-slide experience and wiring a new component; no requirement asks to alter TeddyGameSlide itself.",

      "description": "Expanded/changed global romantic theme tokens and added multiple new animations/utilities in global CSS.",
      "reason": "While potentially supportive of the new ending game’s visuals, the BuildRequest did not explicitly request global theme/token refactoring or additional site-wide animations beyond implementing the new ending mini-game.",
